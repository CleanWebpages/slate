# Introduction

Welcome to the Recon Advisor API! This is a work in progress so please feel free to contact us with any suggestions or comments. Thanks!

# Authentication

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'reconadvisor'

api = ReconAdvisor::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import reconadvisor

api = reconadvisor.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const reconadvisor = require('reconadvisor');

let api = reconadvisor.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

ReconAdvisor uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new ReconAdvisor API key at our [developer portal](https://api.reconadvisor.com/developers).

ReconAdvisor expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.

# Vehicles

## Get All Vehicles

```ruby
require 'reconadvisor'

api = ReconAdvisor::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
api.vehicles.get
```

```python
import reconadvisor

api = reconadvisor.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
api.vehicles.get()
```

```shell
curl "https://api.reconadvisor.com/api/vehicles"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const reconadvisor = require('reconadvisor');

let api = reconadvisor.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
let vehicles = api.vehicles.get();
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fluffums",

    "fluffiness": 6,
